# Kuva

Kuva (Finnish: _image/picture_) is a Kotlin Multiplatform camera library that unifies Android CameraX and iOS AVFoundation behind one clean API. It focuses on preview + photo capture with first-class controls (tap-to-focus, zoom, EV, torch/flash), viewport alignment, normalized coordinates, and a lightweight debug HUDâ€”all designed for Compose MPP and modern app architectures.
